# PythoniC
PythoniC is my attempt to pythonise C language. To pythonise is to use C with its speed and to do complex tasks using relatively simpler syntax.
As the beginning of this attempt,two header files *pyarraylib.h* and *pymatlib.h* are uploaded dealing with basic I/O and some operations on array and matrix.
